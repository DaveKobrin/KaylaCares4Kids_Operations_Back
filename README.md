# Kayla Cares 4 Kids
## Operations Back-End
Kayla Cares 4 Kids, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Kayla Cares 4 Kids’ mission is to help sick kids feel better by providing entertainment and educational items to children’s hospitals, Ronald McDonald Houses and related pediatric facilities worldwide.


## Project Description
> Include:<br />
> General App Idea/Purpose<br />
 This project is the back-end and database connection to support the daily operations of their work. The first stage of this will be targeted toward inventory of donations of various entertainment and educational items. This will eventually grow to manage requests for items from their client hospitals and facilities as well as tracking the financial information that they need for managing the organization.

> What technology stack(s) are you using for your frontend / backend?<br />
I will be using PostgreSQL for the data store,
Flask for the api,
React Native for the front end to allow for mobile device usage for the receipt of donations

> Models including field names and their datatypes<br />

> A list of routes (e.g. `POST /pins/ allows users to post a picture of a pin`)<br />

## Wireframes
> Wireframes with basic page layouts<br />
> Copy and paste or drag and drop your images here.

## Feasibility Study
> If you're using an external API or scraping a website, make sure you can get that data. If you're using a new language, framework, or tool, go through it's getting started tutorial. We *will* ask to see your results. If you are planning to use an API, please show an example of a successful fetch below to the API you wish to use in your project.

## User Stories
> User stories detailing app functionality<br />
> Add user stories following the _As a [type of user], I want [what the user wants], so that [what it helps accomplish]_ format.
